Passionate about programming since the age of 10, I taught myself C and C++ before learning about full-stack development, then machine learning and data engineering.

I now graduated from a Software Engineering degree from ENSIIE and a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence from Paris-Saclay University, and I am looking to solve challenging problems in the field of Artificial Intelligence as I did previously at Owkin and Natixis. I have experiences working with Computer Vision, NLP (including LLMs), Generative AI, and Reinforcement Learning
